This web application constitutes a segment of my graduation project, designed to serve as a comprehensive platform tailored for the healthcare sector.
It encompasses a diverse array of hospital entities, including hospitals, doctors, and administrators.
It plays a pivotal role in creating comprehensive medical histories for each patient, enabling doctors to access vital information pertinent to patient care.
Additionally, doctors possess the capability to seamlessly view all reservations booked by patients.
Patients, in turn, benefit from the ability to conveniently schedule appointments via the platform.
Additionally, this web application serves as an integrated system, augmenting operational efficiencies within the hospital environment.
